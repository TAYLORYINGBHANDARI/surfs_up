# surfs_up
A Climate Analysis and Data Exploration of Climate Database SQLite,Python,Jupyter Notebook
## Project Overview
W. Avy l wants more information about temperature trends in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
### completing tasks
* Use the hawaii.sqlite database file to begin the climate analysis and data exploration.
    1. write a query that filters the date column from the Measurement table to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June.

    2. Generate the summary statistics for the June temperatures DataFrame.

* Use the hawaii.sqlite database file to begin the climate analysis and data exploration.
    1. write a query that filters the date column from the Measurement table to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of December.

    2. Generate the summary statistics for the December temperatures DataFrame.

* write a report that describes the key differences in weather between June and December and two recommendations for further analysis.


## Results
After the data exploration, we were able to retrieve June and December temperatures datas.
we also got the summary for both months.
- The highest temperature in June is 85 and in 83 December,very close.
- The average temperature in June is 75 and in 71 December,whichi is very similar.
- The lowest temperature in June is 64 and in 56 December,shows a little difference,there might be a possibility to affect the icecream business due to the lowerest temperature.
- However, the standard deviations of 3.25 (June) and 3.74 (December) we would expect just a little difference.

## Summary

Oevrall the weather in December and June are  very similar based on historic data from 2010-2017. 
For W. Avy to have more weather data trends, we analyzed the precipation statistics in June and December. We can see December will have a little bit more precipitation. The mean in December(0.21) is higher than the mean in June(0.13).
However, I think for better understanding and gain the confidence in investment. We need further investigation on the anually avarge temperate and precipation from historic record from 2010 to 2017.
Also,we can figure out the weather data from the closest weather station based on our prospective location. It will provide us more accurate and better data.
